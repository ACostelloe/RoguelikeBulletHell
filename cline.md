# cline.md — Post ZoneBuilder Integration (World Rendering Fully Fixed)

---

## ✅ Core Architecture Summary

- 🎯 ECS-driven Entity system (TransformComponent, SpriteComponent, PhysicsComponent, HealthComponent, PlayerStats).
- 🎯 BulletManager + EnemyManager externalized.
- 🎯 Full OOP State Management via GameStateManager (MenuState, PlayingState, PausedState).
- 🎯 World Streaming: WorldManager + ChunkManager fully functional.
- 🎯 Renderer consolidated into render_all().
- 🎯 InputManager drives player firing, menu control.
- 🎯 Combat Loop Phase 2 fully operational (cooldowns, AI tracking, collisions, loot stubs).
- 🎯 Debugging print scaffolding active.
- 🎯 ✅ NEW: ZoneBuilder system converts templates into fully renderable Zones.
- 🎯 ✅ Tiles now fully initialized from TileFactory.

## 🌍 ZoneBuilder Architecture

- Templates loaded by `ZoneTemplateLoader` as ZoneTemplates (pure data).
- ZoneBuilder takes ZoneTemplate and returns full runtime Zone with loaded Tile instances.
- Each Tile contains:
  - sprite: pygame.Surface
  - rect: pygame.Rect (used for rendering position)
- ZoneBuilder ensures every zone is visually rendered correctly.

### ZoneBuilder Usage Example:

```python
template = self.template_loader.load_template("ash_cathedral")
self.active_zone = self.zone_builder.build_zone(template)
```

## 📦 Module Map

### Managers

- EntityManager — pooled entities (loot, etc.)
- BulletManager — bullet list, movement, rendering
- EnemyManager — enemy list, AI update, rendering
- InputManager — keyboard input capture
- WorldManager — zone streaming, template requests
- ChunkManager — active zone management by camera position
- ZoneBuilder — converts templates into active runtime zones

### Renderer

- Single entrypoint `render_all(surface, camera, world_manager, entity_manager, bullet_manager, enemy_manager, ui_manager)`

### GameState System

- MenuState, PlayingState, PausedState fully active.

### Combat

- Input-based firing (spacebar)
- AI tracks player via TransformComponent
- Collision checks remove enemies
- Loot drop placeholder hooks live

## 🔧 Next Work Queue

- Combat Phase 3: Loot drops, scoring, damage to player, enemy firing
- Persistence (Save/Load)
- Audio System integration
- Menu polish (UI panels & buttons)

## 🚀 Current Stability

✅ You are now fully into true beta playable build.
- Zones render correctly.
- Combat loop works.
- Input + states stable.
- Rendering fully wired.
